## Subject Informaton

Information and statistics collected and produced during the study, which includes projects, issues and labels.   
Detailed description for the files can be found [here](#headers).  
You can match entries between files using ```project_id```, ```issue_id```, and ```label_id```.   

- ```projects.csv```: information of the projects.
- ```project_close_dist.csv```: distribution of close rate and time for the projects.
- ```multi-prj-issue-ratio.csv```: the ratio of no-label, single, and multi label issues for Multi group projects.
- ```labels.tar.gz```: a compressed file for ```labels.csv```, which contains label information.

For issue data, we have large files which are not suitable for GitHub.   
Hence we share it via an external link [issue_data.tar.gz](https://seoultechackr-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jindae_kim_seoultech_ac_kr/EeD1xk4hmQJLq6aHm1DrvgUByMJRX5BBHE1-eAACov414w?e=YVCC55).
